# Startup notes for final exam:
# Ports

When you connect to a device on the internet you need both an IP address and a numbered port. Port numbers allow a single device to support multiple protocols (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or SSH) as well as different types of services (e.g. search, document, or authentication). The ports may be exposed externally, or they may only be used internally on the device. For example, the HTTPS port (443) might allow the world to connect, the SSH port (22) might only allow computers at your school, and a service defined port (say 3000) may only allow access to processes running on the device.

The internet governing body, IANA, defines the standard usage for port numbers. Ports from 0 to 1023 represent standard protocols. Generally a web service should avoid these ports unless it is providing the protocol represented by the standard. Ports from 1024 to 49151 represent ports that have been assigned to requesting entities. However, it is very common for these ports to be used by services running internally on a device. Ports from 49152 to 65535 are considered dynamic and are used to create dynamic connections to a device. [Here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml) is the link to IANA's registry.

Here is a list of common port numbers that you might come across.

| Port | Protocol                                                                                           |

| 22   | Secure Shell (SSH) for connecting to remote devices                                                |
| 25   | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email                                             |

| 161  | Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing network devices such as routers or printers |
| 194  | Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for chatting                                                             |
| 443  | HTTP Secure (HTTPS) for secure web requests                                                        |

## Your ports

As an example of how ports are used we can look at your web server. When you built your web server you externally exposed port 22 so that you could use SSH to open a remote console on the server, port 443 for secure HTTP communication, and port 80 for unsecure HTTP communication.

![Ports](webServicesPorts.jpg)

Your web service, Caddy, is listening on ports 80 and 443. When Caddy gets a request on port 80, it automatically redirects the request to port 443 so that a secure connection is used. When Caddy gets a request on port 443 it examines the path provided in the HTTP request (as defined by the URL) and if the path matches a static file, it reads the file off disk and returns it. If the HTTP path matches one of the definitions it has for a gateway service, Caddy makes a connection on that service's port (e.g. 3000 or 4000) and passes the request to the service.

Internally on your web server, you can have as many web services running as you would like. However, you must make sure that each one uses a different port to communicate on. You run your Simon service on port 3000 and therefore **cannot** use port 3000 for your startup service. Instead you use port 4000 for your startup service. It does not matter what high range port you use. It only matters that you are consistent and that they are only used by one service.

# HTTP

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

HTTP is how the web talks. When a web browser makes a request to a web server it does it using the HTTP protocol. In previous instruction we discussed how to use HTTP. Now, we will talk about the internals of HTTP. Just like becoming fluent in a foreign language make a visit to another country more enjoyable, understanding how to speak HTTP helps you communicate effectively when talking on the web.

When a web client (e.g. a web browser) and a web server talk they exchange HTTP requests and responses. The browser will make an HTTP request and the server will generate an HTTP response. You can see the HTTP exchange by using the browser's debugger or by using a console tool like Curl. For example, in your console you can use curl to make the following request.

```sh
curl -v -s http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html
```

### Request

The HTTP request for the above command would look like the following.

```http
GET /hypertext/WWW/Helping.html HTTP/1.1
Host: info.cern.ch
Accept: text/html
```

An HTTP request has this general syntax.

```yaml
<verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

The first line of the HTTP request contains the `verb` of the request, followed by the path, parameters, and anchor of the URL, and finally the version of HTTP being used. The following lines are optional headers that are defined by key value pairs. After the headers you have an optional body. The body start is delimited from the headers with two new lines.

In the above example, we are asking to `GET` a resource found at the path `/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html`. The version used by the request is `HTTP/1.1`. This is followed by two headers. The first specifies the requested host (i.e. domain name). The second specifies what type of resources the client will accept. The resource type is always a [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) as defined by internet governing body IANA. In this case we are asking for HTML.

### Response

The response to the above request looks like this.

```yaml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 21:54:42 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Thu, 29 Oct 1992 11:15:20 GMT
ETag: "5f0-28f29422b8200"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1520
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<TITLE>Helping -- /WWW</TITLE>
<NEXTID 7>
<H1>How can I help?</H1>There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing
the <A NAME=4 HREF=TheProject.html>web</A> grow and be even more useful...
```

An HTTP response has the following syntax.

```yaml
<version> <status code> <status string>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

You can see that the response syntax is similar to the request syntax. The major difference is that the first line represents the version and the status of the response.

Understanding the meaning of the common HTTP verbs, status codes, and headers is important for you to understand, as you will use them in developing a web application. Take some time to internalize the following common values.

## Verbs

There are several verbs that describe what the HTTP request is asking for. The list below only describes the most common ones.

| Verb    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET     | Get the requested resource. This can represent a request to get a single resource or a resource representing a list of resources.                                                                                                                        |
| POST    | Create a new resource. The body of the request contains the resource. The response should include a unique ID of the newly created resource.                                                                                                             |
| PUT     | Update a resource. Either the URL path, HTTP header, or body must contain the unique ID of the resource being updated. The body of the request should contain the updated resource. The body of the response may contain the resulting updated resource. |
| DELETE  | Delete a resource. Either the URL path or HTTP header must contain the unique ID of the resource to delete.                                                                                                                                              |
| OPTIONS | Get metadata about a resource. Usually only HTTP headers are returned. The resource itself is not returned.                                                                                                                                              |

## Status codes

It is important that you use the standard HTTP status codes in your HTTP responses so that the client of a request can know how to interpret the response. The codes are partitioned into five blocks.

- 1xx - Informational.
- 2xx - Success.
- 3xx - Redirect to some other location, or that the previously cached resource is still valid.
- 4xx - Client errors. The request is invalid.
- 5xx - Server errors. The request cannot be satisfied due to an error on the server.

Within those ranges here are some of the more common codes. See the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for a full description of status codes.

| Code | Text                                                                                 | Meaning                                                                                                                           |

## Headers

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response. This includes things like how to handle security, caching, data formats, and cookies. Some common headers that you will use include the following.

| Header                      | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Cookie                      | SessionID=39s8cgj34; csrftoken=9dck2 | Key value pairs that are generated by the server and stored on the client.                                                                                                     |
| Host                        | info.cern.ch                         | The domain name of the server. This is required in all requests.                                                                                                               |

## Body

The format of the body of an HTTP request or response is defined by the `Content-Type` header. For example, it may be HTML text (text/html), a binary image format (image/png), JSON (application/json), or JavaScript (text/javascript). A client may specify what formats it accepts using the `accept` header.

## Cookies

![Cookie](webServicesCookie.png)

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Using HTTP cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)

HTTP itself is stateless. This means that one HTTP request does not know anything about a previous or future request. However, that does not mean that a server or client cannot track state across requests. One common method for tracking state is the `cookie`. Cookies are generated by a server and passed to the client as an HTTP header.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Set-Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty; SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly
```

The client then caches the cookie and returns it as an HTTP header back to the server on subsequent requests.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty
```

This allows the server to remember things like the language preference of the user, or the user's authentication credentials. A server can also use cookies to track, and share, everything that a user does. However, there is nothing inherently evil about cookies, the problem comes from web applications that use them as a means to violate a user's privacy or inappropriately monetize their data.

## HTTP Versions

HTTP continually evolves in order to increase performance and support new types of applications. You can read about the evolution of HTTP on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP).

| Year | Version | Features                                        |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1990 | HTTP0.9 | one line, no versions, only get                 |
| 1996 | HTTP1   | get/post, header, status codes, content-type    |
| 1997 | HTTP1.1 | put/patch/delete/options, persistent connection |
| 2015 | HTTP2   | multiplex, server push, binary representation   |
| 2022 | HTTP3   | QUIC for transport protocol, always encrypted   |


# Fetch

🔑 **Recommended reading**: [MDN Using the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

The ability to make HTTP requests from JavaScript is one of the main technologies that changed the web from static content pages (Web 1.0) to one of web applications (Web 2.0) that fully interact with the user. Microsoft introduced the first API for making HTTP requests from JavaScript with the [XMLHttpRequest API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

Today, the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is the preferred way to make HTTP requests. The `fetch` function is built into the browser's JavaScript runtime. This means you can call it from JavaScript code running in a browser.

The basic usage of fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. The promise `then` function takes a callback function that is asynchronously called when the requested URL content is obtained. If the returned content is of type `application/json` you can use the `json` function on the response object to convert it to a JavaScript object.

The following example makes a fetch request to get and display an inspirational quote.

```js
fetch('https://api.quotable.io/random')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
```

**Response**

```js
{
  content: 'Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.',
  author: 'Thomas Jefferson',
};
```

To do a POST request you populate the options parameter with the HTTP method and headers.

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'test title',
    body: 'test body',
    userId: 1,
  }),
  headers: {
    'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
  },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
```



# Web frameworks

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Introduction to client-side frameworks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Introduction)

Web frameworks seek to make the job of writing web applications easier by providing tools for completing common application tasks. This includes things like modularizing code, creating single page applications, simplifying reactivity, and supporting diverse hardware devices.

Some frameworks take things beyond the standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and create new hybrid file formats that combine things like HTML and JavaScript into a single file. Examples of this include React JSX, Vue SFC, and Svelte files. Abstracting away the core web file formats puts the focus on functional components rather than files.

There are lots of web frameworks to choose from and they evolve all the time. You can view the latest popularity poll at [StateOfJS](https://stateofjs.com).

![web frameworks](stateofjs-webframeworks.jpg)

\- **Source**: _StateOfJS web framework poll_

Each framework has advantages and disadvantages. Some are very perscriptive (opinionated) about how to do things, some have major institutional backing, others have a strong open source community. Other factors you want to consider include how easy it is to learn, how it impacts productivity, how performant it is, how long it takes to build, and how actively the framework is evolving.

## Hello world examples

For our classwork we will use the web framework React. However, before we dig into React let's look at how the major frameworks would render a simple hello world application.

### Vue

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single file. HTML is represented by a `template` element that can be aggregated into other templates.

**SFC**

```html
<script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        name: 'world',
      };
    },
  };
</script>

<style>
  p {
    color: green;
  }
</style>

<template>
  <p>Hello {{ name }}!</p>
</template>
```

### Svelte

Like Vue, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single file. The difference here is that Svelte requires a transpiler to generate browser ready code, instead of a runtime virtual DOM.

**Svelte file**

```html
<script>
  let name = 'world';
</script>

<style>
  p {
    color: green;
  }
</style>

<p>Hello {name}!</p>
```

### React

React combines JavaScript and HTML into its component format. CSS must be declared outside of the JSX file. The component itself highly leverages the functionality of JavaScript and can be represented as a function or class.

**JSX**

```jsx
import 'hello.css';

const Hello = () => {
  let name = 'world';

  return <p>Hello {name}</p>;
};
```

**CSS**

```css
p {
  color: green;
}
```

### Angular component

An Angular component defines what JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are combined together. This keeps a fairly strong separation of files what are usually grouped together in a directory rather than using the single file representation.

**JS**

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello-world',
  templateUrl: './hello-world.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./hello-world.component.css'],
})
export class HelloWorldComponent {
  name: string;
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'world';
  }
}
```

**HTML**

```html
<p>hello {{name}}</p>
```

**CSS**

```css
p {
  color: green;
}
```


# Express

<img src="expressIcon.png" width="75px" />

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Express/Node introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

In the previous instruction you saw how to use Node.js to create a simple web server. This works great for little projects where you are trying to quickly serve up some web content, but to build a production ready application you need a framework with a bit more functionality for easily implementing a full web service. This is where the Node package `Express` come in. Express provides support for:

1. Routing requests for service endpoints
1. Manipulating HTTP requests with JSON body content
1. Generating HTTP responses
1. Using `middleware` to add functionality

Express was created by TJ Holowaychuk and is currently maintained by the [Open.js Foundation](https://openjsf.org/).

Everything in Express revolves around creating and using HTTP routing and middleware functions.
You create an Express application by using NPM to install the Express package and then calling the `express` constructor to create the express application and listen for HTTP requests on a desired port.

```sh
➜ npm install express
```

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.listen(8080);
```

With the app object you can now add HTTP routing and middleware functions to the application.

## Defining routes

HTTP endpoints are implemented in Express by defining routes that call a function based upon an HTTP path. The Express app object supports all of the HTTP verbs as functions on the object. For example, if you want to have a route function that handles an HTTP GET request for the URL path `/store/provo` you would call the `get` method on the app.

```js
app.get('/store/provo', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ name: 'provo' });
});
```

The `get` function takes two parameters, a URL path matching pattern, and a callback function that is invoked when the pattern matches. The path matching parameter is used to match against the URL path of an incoming HTTP request.

The callback function has three parameters that represent the HTTP request object (`req`), the HTTP response object (`res`), and the `next` routing function that Express expects to be called if this routing function wants another function to generate a response.

The express app compares the routing function patterns in the order that they are added to the Express app object. So if you have two routing functions with patterns that both match, the first one that was added will be called and given the next matching function in the `next` parameter.

In our example above we hard coded the store name to be `provo`. A real store endpoint would allow any store name to be provided as a parameter in the path. Express supports path parameters by prefixing the parameter name with a colon (`:`). Express creates a map of path parameters and populates it with the matching values found in the URL path. You then reference the parameters using the `req.params` object. Using this pattern you can rewrite our getStore endpoint as follows.

```js
app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ name: req.params.storeName });
});
```

If we run our JavaScript using node we can see the result when make an HTTP request using curl.

```sh
➜ curl localhost:8080/store/orem
{"name":"orem"}
```

If you wanted an endpoint that used the POST or DELETE HTTP verb then you just use the `post` or `delete` function on the Express app object.

The route path can also include a limited wildcard syntax or even full regular expressions in path pattern. Here are a couple route functions using different pattern syntax.

```js
// Wildcard - matches /store/x and /star/y
app.put('/st*/:storeName', (req, res) => res.send({ update: req.params.storeName }));

// Pure regular expression
app.delete(/\/store\/(.+)/, (req, res) => res.send({ delete: req.params[0] }));
```

Notice that in these examples the `next` parameter was omitted. Since we are not calling `next` we do not need to include it as a parameter. However, if you do not call next then no following middleware functions will be invoked for the request.

## Using middleware

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [Express Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html)

The standard [Mediator/Middleware](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/mediator-pattern/) design pattern has two pieces: A mediator and middleware. Middleware represents componentized pieces of functionality. The mediator loads the middleware components and determines their order of execution. When a request comes to the mediator it then passes the request around to the middleware components. Following this pattern, Express is the mediator, and middleware functions are the middleware components.

Express comes with a standard set of middleware functions. These provide functionality like routing, authentication, CORS, sessions, serving static web files, cookies, and logging. Some middleware functions are provided by default, and other ones must be installed using NPM before you can use it. You can also write your own middleware functions and use them with Express.

A middleware function looks very similar to a routing function. That is because routing functions are also middleware functions. The only difference is that routing functions are only called if the associated pattern matches. Middleware functions are always called for every HTTP request unless a preceding middleware function does not call `next`. A middleware function has the following pattern:

```js
function middlewareName(req, res, next)
```

The middleware function parameters represent the HTTP request object (`req`), the HTTP response object (`res`), and the `next` middleware function to pass processing to. You should usually call the `next` function after completing processing so that the next middleware function can execute.

![Middleware](webServicesMiddleware.jpg)

### Creating your own middleware

As an example of writing your own middleware, you can create a function that logs out the URL of the request and then passes on processing to the next middleware function.

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.originalUrl);
  next();
});
```

Remember that the order that you add your middleware to the Express app object controls the order that the middleware functions are called. Any middleware that does not call the next function after doing its processing, **stops the middleware chain from continuing.**

### Builtin middleware

In addition to creating your own middleware functions, you can use a built-in middleware function. Here is an example of using the `static` middleware function. This middleware responds with static files, found in a given directory, that match the request URL.

```js
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

Now if you create a subdirectory in your project directory and name it `public` you can serve up any static content that you would like. For example, you could create an `index.html` file that is the default content for your web service. Then when you call your web service without any path the index.html file will be returned.

### Third party middleware

You can also use third party middleware functions by using NPM to install the package and including the package in your JavaScript with the `require` function. The following uses the `cookie-parser` package to simplify the generation and access of cookies.

```sh
➜ npm install cookie-parser
```

```js
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

app.use(cookieParser());

app.post('/cookie/:name/:value', (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie(req.params.name, req.params.value);
  res.send({ cookie: `${req.params.name}:${req.params.value}` });
});

app.get('/cookie', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ cookie: req.cookies });
});
```

It is common for middleware functions to add fields and functions to the `req` and `res` object so that other middleware can access the functionality they provide. You see this happening when the cookie-parser middleware adds the `req.cookies` object for reading cookies, and also adds the `res.cookie` function in order to make it easy to add a cookie to a response.

## Error handling middleware

You can also add middleware for handling errors that occur. Error middleware looks similar to other middleware functions, but it takes an additional `err` parameter that contains the error.

```js
function errorMiddlewareName(err, req, res, next)
```

If you wanted to add a simple error handler for anything that might go wrong while process HTTP requests you could add the following.

```js
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500).send({ type: err.name, message: err.message });
});
```

We can test that our error middleware is getting used by adding a new endpoint that generates an error.

```js
app.get('/error', (req, res, next) => {
  throw new Error('Trouble in river city');
});
```

Now if we use curl to call our error endpoint we can see that the response comes from the error middleware.

```sh
➜ curl localhost:8080/error
{"type":"Error","message":"Trouble in river city"}
```

## Putting it all together

Here is a full example of our web service built using Express.

```js
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const app = express();

// Third party middleware - Cookies
app.use(cookieParser());

app.post('/cookie/:name/:value', (req, res, next) => {
  res.cookie(req.params.name, req.params.value);
  res.send({ cookie: `${req.params.name}:${req.params.value}` });
});

app.get('/cookie', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send({ cookie: req.cookies });
});

// Creating your own middleware - logging
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(req.originalUrl);
  next();
});

// Built in middleware - Static file hosting
app.use(express.static('public'));

// Routing middleware
app.get('/store/:storeName', (req, res) => {
  res.send({ name: req.params.storeName });
});

app.put('/st*/:storeName', (req, res) => res.send({ update: req.params.storeName }));

app.delete(/\/store\/(.+)/, (req, res) => res.send({ delete: req.params[0] }));

// Error middleware
app.get('/error', (req, res, next) => {
  throw new Error('Trouble in river city');
});

app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.status(500).send({ type: err.name, message: err.message });
});

// Listening to a network port
const port = 8080;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

# ☑ Assignment

Create a web service with Express using the following steps.

1. Open your console.
1. Create a directory named testExpress, and change into that directory

   ```sh
   mkdir testExpress
   cd testExpress
   ```

1. Initialize the directory for use with NPM.

   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```

1. Install the `express` and `cookie-parser` packages.

   ```sh
   npm install express cookie-parser
   ```

1. Create a file named `index.js` and paste the example code given above.
1. Create a directory named `public` and add an index.html file with some basic html to the directory.

   ```sh
   mkdir public
   print '<h1>Hello express</h1>' > public/index.html
   ```

1. Run your web service using node (`node index.js`)

   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

1. Open another console window and use Curl to try out your web service by making requests to the endpoints.

   ```sh
   curl localhost:8080
   curl localhost:8080/error
   curl localhost:8080/store/orem
   curl -X PUT localhost:8080/st/orem
   curl -X DELETE localhost:8080/store/orem
   curl -X POST -c cookies.txt localhost:8080/cookie/express/tj
   curl -b cookies.txt localhost:8080/cookie
   ```

1. Develop a mental model in your head about what these commands are doing and how your service is responding. Perhaps creating a [sequence diagram](https://sequencediagram.org/index.html#initialData=C4S2BsFMAIGVIE4DcQGMYCVIEcCukBnYAgKBIENVgB7BaAYVwXDMeYFoA+eZNSALmgBtAAoBVACoBdaAHois2pAC2JAHbVgMBCADmAC2DRqAMziIU6fuQAONgHQ3cwABQByecABUs-kSUAcuTKkG4ANAA6atAuCDhh0HEEAJTQALyciYT2BJBqACYuUQDe0Lg2+eRagnHYjuQIwQQ5NHFBIdAAvsnJANwkbOAAPEPs7DyWAtDFAETllVoz-DNKyjOdJEA) will help clarify the interaction if it is still unclear.

   ![HTTP request](httpRequestSequenceDiagram.jpg)

When you are done executing the above commands copy the output from the console window and paste it into the Canvas assignment.


# Express Personal notes
The method of a fetch is what express middleware to use. Example:

```js
const r = await fetch('/fav/ringo', {
  method: 'DELETE'
  });
```
We could need a delete middleware in this case. Like so

```js
app.delete('/favorite/:id', () => {})
```
