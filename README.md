# Startup notes for final exam:
# Ports

When you connect to a device on the internet you need both an IP address and a numbered port. Port numbers allow a single device to support multiple protocols (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, or SSH) as well as different types of services (e.g. search, document, or authentication). The ports may be exposed externally, or they may only be used internally on the device. For example, the HTTPS port (443) might allow the world to connect, the SSH port (22) might only allow computers at your school, and a service defined port (say 3000) may only allow access to processes running on the device.

The internet governing body, IANA, defines the standard usage for port numbers. Ports from 0 to 1023 represent standard protocols. Generally a web service should avoid these ports unless it is providing the protocol represented by the standard. Ports from 1024 to 49151 represent ports that have been assigned to requesting entities. However, it is very common for these ports to be used by services running internally on a device. Ports from 49152 to 65535 are considered dynamic and are used to create dynamic connections to a device. [Here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml) is the link to IANA's registry.

Here is a list of common port numbers that you might come across.

| Port | Protocol                                                                                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20   | File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for data transfer                                                     |
| 22   | Secure Shell (SSH) for connecting to remote devices                                                |
| 25   | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email                                             |

| 80   | Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web requests                                                |
| 110  | Post Office Protocol (POP3) for retrieving email                                                   |
| 123  | Network Time Protocol (NTP) for managing time                                                      |
| 161  | Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing network devices such as routers or printers |
| 194  | Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for chatting                                                             |
| 443  | HTTP Secure (HTTPS) for secure web requests                                                        |

## Your ports

As an example of how ports are used we can look at your web server. When you built your web server you externally exposed port 22 so that you could use SSH to open a remote console on the server, port 443 for secure HTTP communication, and port 80 for unsecure HTTP communication.

![Ports](webServicesPorts.jpg)

Your web service, Caddy, is listening on ports 80 and 443. When Caddy gets a request on port 80, it automatically redirects the request to port 443 so that a secure connection is used. When Caddy gets a request on port 443 it examines the path provided in the HTTP request (as defined by the URL) and if the path matches a static file, it reads the file off disk and returns it. If the HTTP path matches one of the definitions it has for a gateway service, Caddy makes a connection on that service's port (e.g. 3000 or 4000) and passes the request to the service.

Internally on your web server, you can have as many web services running as you would like. However, you must make sure that each one uses a different port to communicate on. You run your Simon service on port 3000 and therefore **cannot** use port 3000 for your startup service. Instead you use port 4000 for your startup service. It does not matter what high range port you use. It only matters that you are consistent and that they are only used by one service.

# HTTP

ðŸ“– **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

HTTP is how the web talks. When a web browser makes a request to a web server it does it using the HTTP protocol. In previous instruction we discussed how to use HTTP. Now, we will talk about the internals of HTTP. Just like becoming fluent in a foreign language make a visit to another country more enjoyable, understanding how to speak HTTP helps you communicate effectively when talking on the web.

When a web client (e.g. a web browser) and a web server talk they exchange HTTP requests and responses. The browser will make an HTTP request and the server will generate an HTTP response. You can see the HTTP exchange by using the browser's debugger or by using a console tool like Curl. For example, in your console you can use curl to make the following request.

```sh
curl -v -s http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html
```

### Request

The HTTP request for the above command would look like the following.

```http
GET /hypertext/WWW/Helping.html HTTP/1.1
Host: info.cern.ch
Accept: text/html
```

An HTTP request has this general syntax.

```yaml
<verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

The first line of the HTTP request contains the `verb` of the request, followed by the path, parameters, and anchor of the URL, and finally the version of HTTP being used. The following lines are optional headers that are defined by key value pairs. After the headers you have an optional body. The body start is delimited from the headers with two new lines.

In the above example, we are asking to `GET` a resource found at the path `/hypertext/WWW/Helping.html`. The version used by the request is `HTTP/1.1`. This is followed by two headers. The first specifies the requested host (i.e. domain name). The second specifies what type of resources the client will accept. The resource type is always a [MIME type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) as defined by internet governing body IANA. In this case we are asking for HTML.

### Response

The response to the above request looks like this.

```yaml
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 06 Dec 2022 21:54:42 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Thu, 29 Oct 1992 11:15:20 GMT
ETag: "5f0-28f29422b8200"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1520
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

<TITLE>Helping -- /WWW</TITLE>
<NEXTID 7>
<H1>How can I help?</H1>There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing
the <A NAME=4 HREF=TheProject.html>web</A> grow and be even more useful...
```

An HTTP response has the following syntax.

```yaml
<version> <status code> <status string>
[<header key: value>]*
[

  <body>
]
```

You can see that the response syntax is similar to the request syntax. The major difference is that the first line represents the version and the status of the response.

Understanding the meaning of the common HTTP verbs, status codes, and headers is important for you to understand, as you will use them in developing a web application. Take some time to internalize the following common values.

## Verbs

There are several verbs that describe what the HTTP request is asking for. The list below only describes the most common ones.

| Verb    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET     | Get the requested resource. This can represent a request to get a single resource or a resource representing a list of resources.                                                                                                                        |
| POST    | Create a new resource. The body of the request contains the resource. The response should include a unique ID of the newly created resource.                                                                                                             |
| PUT     | Update a resource. Either the URL path, HTTP header, or body must contain the unique ID of the resource being updated. The body of the request should contain the updated resource. The body of the response may contain the resulting updated resource. |
| DELETE  | Delete a resource. Either the URL path or HTTP header must contain the unique ID of the resource to delete.                                                                                                                                              |
| OPTIONS | Get metadata about a resource. Usually only HTTP headers are returned. The resource itself is not returned.                                                                                                                                              |

## Status codes

It is important that you use the standard HTTP status codes in your HTTP responses so that the client of a request can know how to interpret the response. The codes are partitioned into five blocks.

- 1xx - Informational.
- 2xx - Success.
- 3xx - Redirect to some other location, or that the previously cached resource is still valid.
- 4xx - Client errors. The request is invalid.
- 5xx - Server errors. The request cannot be satisfied due to an error on the server.

Within those ranges here are some of the more common codes. See the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) for a full description of status codes.

| Code | Text                                                                                 | Meaning                                                                                                                           |

## Headers

ðŸ“– **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response. This includes things like how to handle security, caching, data formats, and cookies. Some common headers that you will use include the following.

| Header                      | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Accept                      | image/\*                             | What content format the client accepts. This may include wildcards.                                                                                                            |
| Content-Type                | text/html; charset=utf-8             | The format of the response content. These are described using standard [MIME](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types) types. |
| Cookie                      | SessionID=39s8cgj34; csrftoken=9dck2 | Key value pairs that are generated by the server and stored on the client.                                                                                                     |
| Host                        | info.cern.ch                         | The domain name of the server. This is required in all requests.                                                                                                               |

## Body

The format of the body of an HTTP request or response is defined by the `Content-Type` header. For example, it may be HTML text (text/html), a binary image format (image/png), JSON (application/json), or JavaScript (text/javascript). A client may specify what formats it accepts using the `accept` header.

## Cookies

ðŸ“– **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Using HTTP cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)

HTTP itself is stateless. This means that one HTTP request does not know anything about a previous or future request. However, that does not mean that a server or client cannot track state across requests. One common method for tracking state is the `cookie`. Cookies are generated by a server and passed to the client as an HTTP header.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Set-Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty; SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly
```

The client then caches the cookie and returns it as an HTTP header back to the server on subsequent requests.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty
```

This allows the server to remember things like the language preference of the user, or the user's authentication credentials. A server can also use cookies to track, and share, everything that a user does. However, there is nothing inherently evil about cookies, the problem comes from web applications that use them as a means to violate a user's privacy or inappropriately monetize their data.

## HTTP Versions

HTTP continually evolves in order to increase performance and support new types of applications. You can read about the evolution of HTTP on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP).

| Year | Version | Features                                        |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1990 | HTTP0.9 | one line, no versions, only get                 |
| 1996 | HTTP1   | get/post, header, status codes, content-type    |
| 1997 | HTTP1.1 | put/patch/delete/options, persistent connection |
| 2015 | HTTP2   | multiplex, server push, binary representation   |
| 2022 | HTTP3   | QUIC for transport protocol, always encrypted   |


# Fetch

ðŸ”‘ **Recommended reading**: [MDN Using the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

The ability to make HTTP requests from JavaScript is one of the main technologies that changed the web from static content pages (Web 1.0) to one of web applications (Web 2.0) that fully interact with the user. Microsoft introduced the first API for making HTTP requests from JavaScript with the [XMLHttpRequest API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

Today, the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) is the preferred way to make HTTP requests. The `fetch` function is built into the browser's JavaScript runtime. This means you can call it from JavaScript code running in a browser.

The basic usage of fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. The promise `then` function takes a callback function that is asynchronously called when the requested URL content is obtained. If the returned content is of type `application/json` you can use the `json` function on the response object to convert it to a JavaScript object.

The following example makes a fetch request to get and display an inspirational quote.

```js
fetch('https://api.quotable.io/random')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
```

**Response**

```js
{
  content: 'Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.',
  author: 'Thomas Jefferson',
};
```

To do a POST request you populate the options parameter with the HTTP method and headers.

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'test title',
    body: 'test body',
    userId: 1,
  }),
  headers: {
    'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
  },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((jsonResponse) => {
    console.log(jsonResponse);
  });
```
