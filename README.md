Gotta get dat class assignment done.
This is Jaden Taylor doing some majestic modifications.
Jaden Taylor here, not Ryan Reynolds.




I have duplicated this assignment twice, the first time with more success (I called it GittinGood). This second time however, while trying to resolve the merge conflict, VS Code said "can't edit in read only mode." Still unsure how to switch that, or how I was able to make changes the first time around. So I just had to resolve the merge conflict with the commits on both Git and GitHub ommitted. Again, still learning the ropes.
